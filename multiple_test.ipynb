       "  'abstract': \"The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), with its explicit consent requirement, may restrict the use of personal data and shake the foundations of online advertising. The ad industry has predicted drastic loss of revenue from GDPR compliance and has been seeking alternative ways of targeting. Taking advantage of an event created by an ad publisher's request for explicit consent from users with European Union IP addresses, the authors find that for a publisher that uses a pay-per-click model, has the capacity to leverage both user behavior and web page content information for advertising, and observes high consent rates, GDPR compliance leads to modest negative effects on ad performance, bid prices, and ad revenue. The changes in ad metrics can be explained by temporal variations in consent rates. The impact is most pronounced for travel and financial services advertisers and least pronounced for retail and consumer packaged goods advertisers. The authors further find that web page context can compensate for the loss of access to users' personal data, as the GDPR's negative impact is less pronounced when ads are posted on web pages presenting relevant content. The results suggest that publishers and advertisers should leverage targeting based on web page content after the GDPR's rollout. \",\n",

The author says that the U.S. unemployment rate which most economists would agree that it is too high today. It will also be agreed that this observation poses a problem for public policy. Unemployment above the a specified rate is regarded as being of a different character from the frictional unemployment required to match workers and jobs efficiently and is treated from a welfare point of view as waste, or deadweight loss. Elimination of this waste is an objective of monetary, fiscal, and perhaps other policies. The idea that policy can and should be directed at the attainment of a particular specifiable level of the measured rate of unemployment owes it wide acceptance. It is derived from the prior hypothesis that measured unemployment can be decomposed into two distinct components, voluntary and involuntary with full employment then identified as the level prevailing when involuntary unemployment equals zero.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The effective design and implementation of an information system is a complex undertaking which requires management to anticipate the possible effects of different psychological dispositions and various reports on task performance. To provide information that management may use in developing an information system, a group of subjects (n = 403) were (1) classified as high or low analytic depending upon their score on the Embedded Figures Test, (2) given five reports which they ranked according to their perception of the degree of difficulty they expected each report to present in performing a task, and (3) required to answer 20 questions with one of the previously ranked reports. The five reports used in the experiment were a raw data report (Report A) and four reports generated from the information presented in Report A. Report B was a tabular report of the percentage relationship of the raw data. Reports C, D, and E were a histogram of the raw data, a cumulative frequency graphic of the raw data and a cumulative frequency graphic of the percentages respectively. Therefore, there were two groups: High and Low Analytics, five reports and one task. The results of the experiment were (1) the perceived complexity rankings (lowest to highest) for both the high and low analytics were Report A, Report B, Report C, Report D, and Report E, (2) individuals classified as high analytic outperformed the individuals classified as low analytic on each of the five reports, and (3) for both the high and low analytics, task performance decreased as perceived complexity increased. The implications of these results are (1) for tasks similar to the one tested, that task performance may be enhanced by assigning such tasks to high analytic individuals, (2) individuals are able to perceive those reports which are likely to cause performance difficulties, and (3) using the report perceived as least complex is likely to be a valid report specification rule.

Certain goods emerge endogenously as media of exchange, or commodity money, depending both on their intrinsic properties and on extrinsic beliefs. There are also equilibria with genuine fiat currency circulating as the general medium of exchange.

We show qualitatively and quantitatively that contrary to conventional wisdom, if the tax system is initially suboptimal and progressive, the general‐equilibrium \"trickle‐down\" forces may raise the benefits of increasing the marginal tax rates on high incomes.

Rejecting a reduction of the research process to the propositional knowledge it produces, a set of hypotheses on the value of different types of knowledge is derived. The hypotheses are tested with empirical data obtained from scientists formerly employed by the Max Planck Society (MPS), one of the main organisations for basic research in the German innovation system. Findings indicate that rather than applying latest theoretical insights, scientists mainly transfer elements of knowledge that underlie complex problem-solving strategies in basic research.

The ad industry has predicted drastic loss of revenue from GDPR compliance and has been seeking alternative ways of targeting. Taking advantage of an event created by an ad publisher's request for explicit consent from users with European Union IP addresses, the authors find that for a publisher that uses a pay-per-click model, has the capacity to leverage both user behavior and web page content information for advertising, and observes high consent rates, GDPR compliance leads to modest negative effects on ad performance, bid prices, and ad revenue. The changes in ad metrics can be explained by temporal variations in consent rates. The impact is most pronounced for travel and financial services advertisers and least pronounced for retail and consumer packaged goods advertisers. The authors further find that web page context can compensate for the loss of access to users' personal data, as the GDPR's negative impact is less pronounced when ads are posted on web pages presenting relevant content. The results suggest that publishers and advertisers should leverage targeting based on web page content after the GDPR's rollout. \", 'doi': '10.1177/00222437231171848', 'authors': [{'full_name': 'Pengyuan Wang', 'email': 'pengyuan@uga.edu', 'affiliation': 'Assistant Professor of Marketing, Department of Marketing, University of Georgia, USA', 'address': 'Athens, Georgia, USA', 'department': 'Department of Marketing', 'college/school/faculty': 'Terry College of Business', \"if it's a business/management school\": True, 'university/company/institute': 'University of Georgia', 'country': 'US', 'city': 'Athens'}, {'full_name': 'Li Jiang', 'email': 'lijiang1@gwu.edu', 'affiliation': 'Assistant Professor of Marketing, Department of Marketing, George Washington University, USA', 'address': '2121 I St NW, Washington, DC 20052, USA', 'department': 'Department of Marketing', 'college/school/faculty': 'School of Business', \"if it's a business/management school\": True, 'university/company/institute': 'George Washington University', 'country': 'US', 'city': 'Washington'}, {'full_name': 'Jian Yang', 'email': 'jianyang@yahooinc.com', 'affiliation': 'Senior Research Director, Yahoo Inc., USA', 'address': '701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089, USA', 'department': 'Senior Research Director', 'college/school/faculty': 'N/A', \"if it's a business/management school\": False, 'university/company/institute': 'Yahoo Inc.', 'country': 'US', 'city': 'Sunnyvale'}], 'keywords': ['online advertising', 'privacy policy', 'gdpr', 'data regulation'], 'subjects': ['internet advertising', 'data protection', 'consumer behavior', 'personally identifiable information', 'regulatory compliance', 'general data protection regulation, 2016'], 'journal': {'title': 'Journal of Marketing Research', 'volumn': '61', 'issue': '1', 'year': '2024'}}, {'title': 'manufacturing costs and accounts (book).', 'abstract': 'Reviews the book \"Manufacturing Costs and Accounts,\" by A.

The author says that the U.S. unemployment rate which most economists would agree that it is too high today. It will also be agreed that this observation poses a problem for public policy. Unemployment above the a specified rate is regarded as being of a different character from the frictional unemployment required to match workers and jobs efficiently and is treated from a welfare point of view as waste, or deadweight loss. Elimination of this waste is an objective of monetary, fiscal, and perhaps other policies. The idea that policy can and should be directed at the attainment of a particular specifiable level of the measured rate of unemployment owes it wide acceptance. It is derived from the prior hypothesis that measured unemployment can be decomposed into two distinct components, voluntary and involuntary with full employment then identified as the level prevailing when involuntary unemployment equals zero.', 'doi': 'nan', 'authors': [{'full_name': 'Lucas Jr., Robert E.', 'email': 'nan', 'affiliation': 'Department of Economics, University of Chicago, 1126 East 59th Street, Chicago, IL 60637 | Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis', 'address': '1126 East 59th Street, Chicago, IL 60637', 'department': 'Department of Economics', 'college/school/faculty': 'Department of Economics', \"if it's a business/management school\": False, 'university/company/institute': 'University of Chicago', 'country': 'US', 'city': 'Chicago'}], 'keywords': [], 'subjects': ['government policy', 'employment', 'hypothesis', 'unemployment', 'economists'], 'journal': {'title': 'American Economic Review', 'volumn': '68', 'issue': '2', 'year': '1978'}}, {'title': 'the effect of cognitive style and report format on task performance: the mis design consequences.', 'abstract': 'The effective design and implementation of an information system is a complex undertaking which requires management to anticipate the possible effects of different psychological dispositions and various reports on task performance. To provide information that management may use in developing an information system, a group of subjects (n = 403) were (1) classified as high or low analytic depending upon their score on the Embedded Figures Test, (2) given five reports which they ranked according to their perception of the degree of difficulty they expected each report to present in performing a task, and (3) required to answer 20 questions with one of the previously ranked reports. The five reports used in the experiment were a raw data report (Report A) and four reports generated from the information presented in Report A. Report B was a tabular report of the percentage relationship of the raw data. Reports C, D, and E were a histogram of the raw data, a cumulative frequency graphic of the raw data and a cumulative frequency graphic of the percentages respectively. Therefore, there were two groups: High and Low Analytics, five reports and one task. The results of the experiment were (1) the perceived complexity rankings (lowest to highest) for both the high and low analytics were Report A, Report B, Report C, Report D, and Report E, (2) individuals classified as high analytic outperformed the individuals classified as low analytic on each of the five reports, and (3) for both the high and low analytics, task performance decreased as perceived complexity increased. The implications of these results are (1) for tasks similar to the one tested, that task performance may be enhanced by assigning such tasks to high analytic individuals, (2) individuals are able to perceive those reports which are likely to cause performance difficulties, and (3) using the report perceived as least complex is likely to be a valid report specification rule.
